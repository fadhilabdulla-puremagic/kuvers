              We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our
              enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for
              the management of the Horst Kürvers GmbH. The use of the Internet
              pages of the Horst Kürvers GmbH is possible without any indication
              of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special
              enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data
              could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is
              necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we
              generally obtain consent from the data subject.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
              address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in
              line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in
              accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations
              applicable to the Horst Kürvers GmbH. By means of this data
              protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the
              general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal
              data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are
              informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the
              rights to which they are entitled.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              As the controller, the Horst Kürvers GmbH has implemented numerous
              technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete
              protection of personal data processed through this website.
              However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have
              security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For
              this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data
              to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.

              The data protection declaration of the Horst Kürvers GmbH is based
              on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of
              the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection
              declaration should be legible and understandable for the general
              public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure
              this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the

            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">Personal data</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Personal data means any information relating to an identified or
              identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable
              natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
              indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a
              name, an identification number, location data, an online
              identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
              physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
              identity of that natural person.

            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">Data subject</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person,
              whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for
              the processing.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">Processing</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Processing is any operation or set of operations which is
              performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or
              not by automated means, such as collection, recording,
              organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration,
              retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
              dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or

            <p class="mb-4">
              Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data
              with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">Profiling</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data
              consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain
              personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to
              analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's
              performance at work, economic situation, health, personal
              preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or
              movements.

            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">Pseudonymisation</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a
              manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a
              specific data subject without the use of additional information,
              provided that such additional information is kept separately and
              is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that
              the personal data are not attributed to an identified or

              law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination

              receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in
              accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as
              recipients; the processing of those data by those public

              are text files that are stored in a computer system via an
              Internet browser.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain
              a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the
              cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet
              pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser
              in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites
              and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats
              subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A
              specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using
              the unique cookie ID.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Through the use of cookies, the Horst Kürvers GmbH can provide the
              users of this website with more user-friendly services that would
              not be possible without the cookie setting.

              By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website
              can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as
              previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose
              of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our
              website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to
              enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this
              is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the
              user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a
              shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the
              articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart
              via a cookie.

            <p class="mb-4">
              The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies
              through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the
              Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting
              of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any
              time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is
              possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject

              5. Collection of general data and information
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-4">
              The website of the Horst Kürvers GmbH collects a series of general
              data and information when a data subject or automated system calls
              up the website. This general data and information are stored in
              the server log files.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the
              operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website
              from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called
              referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access
              to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP
              address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing
              system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be
              used in the event of attacks on our information technology
              systems.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              When using these general data and information, the Horst Kürvers
              GmbH does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather,
              this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our
              website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well
              as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our
              information technology systems and website technology, and (4)
              provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary
              for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Therefore, the Horst Kürvers GmbH analyzes anonymously collected
              data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the
              data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure
              an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.
              The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately
              from all personal data provided by a data subject.

              6. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-4">
              The data controller shall process and store the personal data of
              the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the
              purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European
              legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which
              the controller is subject to.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period
              prescribed by the European legislator or another competent
              legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or
              erased in accordance with legal requirements.

            </h5>
            <p class="mb-4 fw-bold">Right of confirmation</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European
              legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to
              whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being
              processed. If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right
              of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee
              of the controller.
