              <p>(1)</p>
              <p>
                These general terms and conditions of delivery and payment apply
                to all - including future - supplies, services or offers in
                which Horst Kürvers GmbH or any of its subsidiaries (hereinafter
                Kürvers) is the vendor and contractor, even if they are not
                specifically agreed upon. All supplies, services and offers from
                Kürvers are subject to these Terms and Conditions. These are
                part of all contracts, which Kürvers closes with its contractors
                (hereinafter referred to as "customer") relating to the goods or
                services offered by Kürvers. By placing an order the customer
                agrees to the following Terms and Conditions. With the receipt
                of the goods or the giving of a shipping permit, these
                conditions are at latest considered accepted.
              </p>
              <p>(2)</p>
              <p>
                We contradict the Terms of the customer or a third party. They
                do not apply, even if Kürvers does not object to their validity
                in an individual case. Even if Kürvers receives a letter
                containing the terms of the customer or a third party or refers
                to such, we shall not agree with the application of these terms
                and conditions.
              </p>
              <p class="fw-bold pt-4">§ 2 Offer and closing of contract</p>
              <p>(1)</p>
              <p>
                All offers of Kürvers are non-binding, unless they are
                expressively marked as binding or contain a specific deadline
                for acceptance. Kürvers may accept orders or assignments within
                four weeks of receipt. Only with the acceptance of the offer is
                the contract closed (order confirmation). The order confirmation
                may be in the form of an invoice or delivery note.
              </p>
              <p>(2)</p>
              <p>
                All that matters for the legal relations between Kürvers and the
                customer is the sales contract in its written form, including
                these Conditions. The contract completely reflects all the
                agreements between the parties to contract. Employees of Kürvers
                are not authorized to make binding declarations for Kürvers
                unless they are the managing directors, officers or assistant
                managers. Oral commitments by Kürvers before entering into this
                agreement are not legally binding and oral agreements of the
                parties are replaced by the written contract, except where it is
                explicitly ruled that they remain in force.
              </p>
              <p>(3)</p>
              <p>
                Additions and amendments to agreements made, including these
                General Conditions are only effective if made in writing. With
                the exception of directors and authorized officers employees of
                Kürvers are not authorized to enter into any deviant verbal
                agreements. For the written form it is sufficient to have
                facsimile transmission or email.
              </p>
              <p>(4)</p>
              <p>
                Kürvers retains ownership or copyright on all its issuing of
                offers and quotations, as well as drawings, diagrams,
                calculations, information, catalogues, models, tools and other
                documents and devices provided for the customer. The customer
                may not hand this property or contents of it to third parties,
                publish them or have them published by third parties, use or
                reproduce them without the express consent of Kürvers. The
                customer shall completely return these objects at the request of
                Kürvers and destroy any copies when they are no longer required
                of him in the ordinary course of business or if negotiations do
                not lead to the conclusion of a contract.
              </p>
              <p>(5)</p>
              <p>
                In case Kürvers uses tele-or media services for the purpose of
                concluding the contract, Kürvers is not obliged to
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  make technical resources available to the customer to help the
                  customer identify input errors and correct them;
                </li>
                <li>
                  communicate the specific information mentioned in the
                  Regulation under Article 241 of the Introductory Act to the
                  German Civil Code (EGBGB) before the order;
                </li>
                <li>confirm the receipt of the order.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Furthermore orders and assignments placed by the customer are
                not already considered as validly received, when Kürvers could
                have obtained them under ordinary circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>§ 3 Prices and payment</p>
              <p>(1)</p>
              <p>
                The rates apply to the performance- and delivery volume listed
                in the order confirmation. Additional or special services are
                charged separately. Prices are in Euros unless otherwise agreed,
                ex works, plus packaging, VAT, customs and charges for export
                shipments, and other public charges.
              </p>
              <p>(2)</p>
              <p>
                Offsetting by the customer or the withholding of payments due to
                claims are only permitted where the claims are uncontested or
                bindingly ascertained and due.
              </p>
              <p>(3)</p>
              <p>
                As far as the agreed prices are based on the list prices of
                Kürvers and the delivery shall take place four months after the
                contract, the list prices of Kürvers valid at the day of the
                delivery shall apply (minus an agreed percentage or fixed
                discount).
              </p>
              <p>(4)</p>
              <p>
                Invoices are payable within thirty days without any deduction,
                unless otherwise agreed in writing. For the date of the payment
                the date of receipt at Kürvers is decisive. Checks are valid
                after being cashed. In case the customer does not pay when due,
                an interest of 5% percentage points above the base interest rate
                will be added to the amounts outstanding from the date of
                maturity; the right to claiming higher interest rates and
                further damages in the event of default remains unaffected.
              </p>
              <p>(5)</p>
              <p>
                Kürvers is entitled to perform outstanding deliveries or
                services only against advance payment or security, if it takes
                notice of circumstances after completion of the contract, which
                would notably reduce the creditworthiness of the customer and
                which would put at risk the payment of the outstanding debts
                from the respective contract to Kürvers by the customer
                (including other individual orders for the same general
                conditions).
              </p>
              <p>(6)</p>
              <p>
                The customer is not entitled to transfer rights under this
                contract to another party except payment claims.
              </p>
              <p class="fw-bold pt-4">§ 4 Quality and quantity</p>
              <p>(1)</p>
              <p>
                The character, in particular the quality and material properties
                of the supplied goods is determined first by the applicable
                technical specifications used by Kürvers, if they are missing,
                according to the internationally applicable material norms in
                the contract. If no norms exist, commercial practice shall
                apply.
              </p>
              <p>(2)</p>
              <p>
                Information of Kürvers concerning the subject goods or services
                (e.g. weights, measurements, values in use, handling, tolerances
                and technical data) and our representations of it (e.g. drawings
                and figures) are only approximate, unless the use for the
                contractually intended purpose requires an exact match. They are
                not guaranteed characteristics, but descriptions or
                identifications of goods or services. Usual variations and
                deviations, stipulated by legal regulations or technical
                improvements and the replacement of components with equal parts
                are permissible if they do not affect the suitability for the
                contractually intended purpose.
              </p>
              <p>(3)</p>
              <p>
                Declarations made by Kürvers to the customer on the nature and
                durability of the goods on top of the legal warranty rights are
                only a “quality and durability guarantee” within the meaning of
                § 443 BGB (German Civil Code) if Kürvers has expressly
                designated it a "guarantee".

              <p>
                Kürvers is entitled to cancel the contract if we are not or not

                understood ex works (EXW acc. Incoterms 2010) unless otherwise
                agreed. Should delivery have been agreed, the delivery times and

                of the delivery and performance times, or a postponement of the
                delivery and service dates for the required period, in which the
                customer does not meet its contractual obligations towards
                Kürvers. If the customer changes the specifications or is
                delayed, the delivery period is extended by the time of the
                subsequent delay.

                time of conclusion of predictable events (e.g. breakdowns of any

                delays, strikes, lawful lockouts, lack of laborers, energy or
                raw materials, difficulties in obtaining necessary regulatory

                performance dates are postponed in the extent of the time of the
                impediment plus a reasonable start date. In case the customer’s
                acceptance of the delivery or performance cannot be expected due
                to the delay, he can resign from the contract by immediate

                are made or Kürvers has taken over other services (eg shipping
                or installation). In case there is a default in delivery due to

                The delivered goods must be examined carefully after delivery to
                the customer or to the specific third party. They are considered
                approved if Kürvers does not receive a written complaint in
                terms of obvious deficiencies or other defects that were seen on
                an immediate and thorough investigation within three working
                days after delivery or otherwise within three working days after
                the discovery of the defect or any earlier date, in which the
                defect for the customer in normal use of the delivery item could
                be seen without closer examination. At the request of Kürvers
                the alleged delivery item is returned to Kürvers freight
                prepaid. In case of a justified complaint Kürvers pays the cost
                of the cheapest shipping route; this does not apply if the costs
                increase because the delivery item is at a place other than the
                point of intended use.

                unreasonableness, denial or unreasonable delay in the repair or
                replacement the customer may rescind the contract or may reduce

                Kürvers may not replace for licensing or factual reasons, it is
                up to Kürvers to decide whether it will raise warranty claims
                against the manufacturers and suppliers for the customer’s
                account or assign them to the customer. Warranty claims against
                Kürvers for such defects under the preconditions and these terms
                exist only when the legal enforcement of the aforementioned
                claims against the manufacturers and suppliers has been

                without the consent of Kürvers or has it modified by third
                parties and the removal of defects therefore is made impossible
                or unreasonable. In any case, the customer has to bear the

                payment of all claims from the contract.

              <p>(2)</p>
              <p>
                Kürvers is entitled to repossess the goods if the customer
                breaches the contract.

              <p>(3)</p>
              <p>
                The customer may not without prior written consent of Kürvers
                sell the goods that have been supplied under reserved commodity.
                The customer now assigns in the event of any resale the claims
                from the resale to the extent of the purchase price to be paid
                to us plus a premium of 20%. Kürvers hereby authorizes the
                customer to collect the assigned claims in the ordinary course
                of business and we may revoke this authorization in the event of
                default by the customer at any time.
              </p>
              <p>(4)</p>
              <p>
                In case the the buyer of the customer pays by check, the
                ownership of the check is transferred to Kürvers when it goes to
                the customer. If payment is executed by draft, the customer
                hereby assigns the rights granted to him to Kürvers in advance.
                The transfer of these documents will be replaced with the
                customer keeping them for Kürvers, or if he does not obtain
                immediate possession of them, assigning his claim against a
                third party hereby in advance. He will deliver these papers,
                provided with its endorsement, immediately to Kürvers.
              </p>
              <p>(5)</p>
              <p>
                If Kürvers claims the retention of title, this shall only be
                considered as a withdrawal from the contract, if Kürvers
                declares this expressively in writing. The customer's right to
                possess the subject goods expires if he does not fulfill its
                obligations under this or any other contract.
              </p>

              <p>
                As long as the ownership has not passed to him, the customer is
                obliged to treat the goods with care. In particular, he is
                obliged to insure them at replacement value against theft, fire
                and water damage at his own expense. If maintenance and
                inspection work is carried out, the purchaser has to run them at
                his own expense. As long as the ownership has not been
                transferred to Kürvers, the customer must notify Kürvers
                immediately in writing if the delivered goods are seized or if
                there is any other interference by third parties. If the third
                party is not able to reimburse Kürvers for the judicial and
                extrajudicial costs of a claim under § 771 ZPO (German Civil
                Procedure Code), the customer is responsible for the loss of
                Kürvers.
              </p>
              <p>(7)</p>
              <p>
                Handling and processing of the goods delivered under retention
                of title take place for Kürvers as a manufacturer within the
                meaning of § 950 BGB, without obliging Kürvers. The processed
                goods are considered reserved property for the purposes of
                paragraph (1). In case of processing, and combination of goods
                with other goods by the customer Kürvers remains the owner of
                the new object in proportion of the invoiced value of reserved
                property goods to the invoiced value of other used goods. In
                case the property of Kürvers shall lapse by combining or mixing,
                the customer transfers to us now his ownership rights in the new
                stock or item to the extent of the value of the goods and shall
                keep them free of charge. The resulting co-ownership shall be
                considered as subject goods as defined in section 1.
              </p>
              <p>(8)</p>
              <p>
                Kurvers shall immediately be informed by the customer about a
                seizure or other interference by third parties.
              </p>
              <p>(9)</p>
              <p>
                If the value of existing securities exceeds the secured claims
                by more than 20 per cent, Kürvers is obliged to release
                securities of its choice at the request of the customer.
              </p>
              <p>(10)</p>
              <p>
                The customer may neither pledge the delivery item nor assign it
                to security.

              <p>(11)</p>
              <p>
                If this property is not valid or not executable because of the
                prevailing legal system abroad, the customer commits himself to
                granting Kürvers security rights (mortgages, credit assignments,
                etc.) which come as close as possible to the purpose of
                retention of title.

                All supplies, services and offers of our suppliers are subject
                to these General Terms and Conditions. These terms are part of
                all the contracts we make with our suppliers on the offered

                services or offers to the purchaser, even if they have not been

                particular cases. Even if we refer to a letter, which includes
                the terms and conditions of the supplier or a third party or
                refers to such, we shall not agree with the validity of those

                Supply contracts (order and acceptance) as well as modifications
                and additions must be at least in text form according to § 126b
                BGB, if the parties did not agree on written form in the

                As far as our offers do not include an explicit commitment

                the offer. Relevant to the timely acceptance is the receipt of
                the acceptance by us. Call-offs shall become binding at the
                latest if the supplier does not object within two weeks of the

                at least seven calendar days before the agreed delivery date.
                The same applies to changes of product specifications, as far as
                these can be implemented without significant additional effort
                in the normal production process of the supplier, whereas in
                these cases, the notification period under the preceding
                sentence is at least 14 calendar days. We will reimburse the
                supplier the proven and reasonable costs resulting from this
                change. If such changes result in delivery delays that cannot be
                avoided using reasonable efforts in the normal production and
                business operation of the suppliers, the originally agreed
                delivery date is postponed accordingly. The supplier will give

                these documents to us on our request when they are no longer
                required in the ordinary course of business or if negotiations
                do not lead to the conclusion of a contract. Potential copies
                thereof made by the supplier must be destroyed in this case,
                excluding only the storage under legal obligation, and the
                storing of data for backup purposes in a normal backup
                procedure.

                Tools, equipment and models, which we make available to the
                supplier or that we made for contractual purposes and will be
                charged to us separately by the supplier remain our property or
                become our property. They are to be marked by the supplier as
                our property, carefully maintained, insured against any damages
                and used only for purposes of the contract. The cost of
                maintenance and repair of these items shall be carried by the
                parties - in the absence of a different agreement - one half
                each. Where these costs are due to shortcomings of such objects
                produced by the supplier or the improper use by the supplier,
                its employees or other agents, they are to be borne solely by
                the supplier. The supplier will inform us promptly of all not
                only insignificant damage to such objects. Upon request he is
                obliged to release these objects to us in proper condition if
                they are no longer needed to fulfill the contracts concluded
                with us.

                Retention of title by the supplier shall only apply if they are
                related to our obligation to pay for the products in which the
                supplier retains the ownership. In particular, expanded or
                extended retention of title is not allowed.

                In case of defects we are fully entitled to the legal claims.
                The warranty period is 24 months. It starts with the initial
                startup of the facility of our customers. It shall expire at the
                latest 36 months after delivery.
              </p>
              <p>(2)</p>
              <p>
                Lacks of quality and quantity are to be duly reported. Due
                report is met if the notification has been made to the supplier
                within 14 working days of the discovery of the lack of quality
                or quantity. The obligation to inspect the goods and give notice
                of defects from § 377 HGB is waived and replaced by a quality
                assurance agreement.

                Any limitations are suspended with the receipt of our written
                notice of defects by the supplier. In case of replacement and
                removal of defects, the warranty period for replaced or repaired
                parts will start again, unless we had to assume from the
                behavior of the supplier that it did not see itself obliged to
                the action, but carried out the replacement or removal solely
                out of goodwill or other reasons.

                If we are obliged to carry out a recall against third partied
                because of a failure of a product supplied by the supplier, the
                supplier bears all the costs associated with the recall.

              <p>(1)</p>
              <p>
                The supplier is responsible for all claims made by third parties
                for personal injury or property damage, caused by a defective
                product delivered by him, and herewith exempts us from the
                resulting liability.
              </p>
              <p>(2)</p>
              <p>
                The supplier shall, at its own expense, maintain a product
                liability insurance with minimum coverage of EUR 20.000.000,00,
                which needs not cover the recall risk or criminal or similar
                damages, unless in the individual case it has been agreed
                otherwise. The supplier will send us a copy of the liability
                policy on request at any time.

              <p>(1)</p>
              <p>
                The supplier warrants that no intellectual property rights of
                third parties are violated in connection with its delivery in
                countries in which the products have been produced or are
                delivered to.

              <p>
                The supplier herewith indemnifies us from any claims by third
                parties against us, on grounds specified in paragraph 1 of
                breach of intellectual property right. This includes all
                necessary expenses in connection with these claims. This right
                is independent of any fault of the supplier.

                immediately after the decision. This decision should be -

                cessation of production.
